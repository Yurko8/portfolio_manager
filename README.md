# Portfolio Manager
## Overview
The Portfolio Manager is a Python-based tool designed to help users manage and optimize their financial portfolios. It provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing portfolio performance, managing risk, and generating rebalancing suggestions using advanced techniques like deep learning and financial modeling.

This tool is suitable for both novice and experienced investors, providing the functionality to monitor portfolios, track returns, and adjust strategies based on data-driven insights.

## Features
Portfolio Tracking: Monitor the performance of your investments in real-time, with detailed metrics on returns and portfolio allocation.
Asset Allocation: Efficiently manage asset allocation across categories such as stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
Risk and Performance Metrics: Measure your portfolio's risk using metrics like volatility, Value-at-Risk (VaR), and the Sharpe ratio.
Rebalancing Recommendations: Receive suggestions on how to optimize your portfolio based on desired asset allocation.
## Techniques Used
This project leverages various advanced techniques and libraries to optimize and manage portfolios effectively:

Deep Learning (TensorFlow): TensorFlow is used for modeling and predicting future market movements. The project implements deep learning models to assess potential portfolio performance and guide investment decisions.

PyPortfolioOpt: This library is utilized for optimizing portfolio allocations. Using modern portfolio theory, it helps balance assets in a way that minimizes risk while maximizing returns. It enables efficient frontier calculations and provides optimized weights for different asset classes.

Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM): GBM is employed to simulate stock price movements. This stochastic model helps generate future scenarios for the price trajectory of assets, which is critical for understanding potential risks and returns in uncertain markets.
